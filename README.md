Repo for all the leetcode I do, I don't do much leetcode so its comparatively less than other repos.

I do at least a problem a day.

They're all in Python, I typically include the date, my name, and as much info as possible about the problem in the comments.

Sometimes I'll obfuscate my code to improve speed, but I'll always include the original code.
